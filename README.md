# nano-container
Example of near-smallest-size container, using assembler, to show how small containers can be and how few dependencies they can have.

It just prints "Hello World" to stdout every second so it stays running and demonstrates container output.
The smallest size container would exit immediately, but that is not useful for demonstration purposes.
